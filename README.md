📌 Here's my dashboard on employee attrition analysis. 
🔗 Dived into the data to obtain the important KPIs and constructed this dashboard using POWER BI
📍 Employee attrition refers to long-term vacancies or position eliminations. Attrition can occur throughout an entire company or just in certain departments or divisions. Learning the trends or impact it creates on a company's turnover is efficient.
📋 Hence I have utilized the various interactive visualization tools provided by POWER BI to create an interactive dashboard which conveys the highlights of my story on employee attrition.
